First off, thank you for considering contributing to this portfolio.

Wait, what? Contributing to someone's portfolio? Yes, you read that right. Let me explain.

## The Unusual Nature of This Repository

This repository is a bit of a paradox in the open source world. It's a **personal portfolio** hosted on GitHub—a platform designed for collaborative development. Normally, portfolios don't accept contributions. They're showcases of individual work, not community projects.

But here's the thing: I deeply understand the *purpose* and *value* of `CONTRIBUTING.md` files in open source projects. They're essential documents that set expectations, streamline collaboration, and build healthy communities. Every proper FOSS project should have one.

So this file exists to demonstrate that understanding… while acknowledging the obvious truth that you can't fork someone's career. You have to write your own code, forge your own path. Copying career steps—like copying code without understanding it—creates neither value for the world nor growth for yourself.

## How to Actually “Contribute”

If you want to make changes to this portfolio—add new projects, update achievements, expand the skills section—there's exactly **one way** to do that:

### Hire me.

That's right. The only pull requests this repository accepts are employment offers that will generate new content for future portfolio updates.

## Ideal “Maintainer” Profile

The best contributions to this portfolio come from employers who:

**Understand the value of multipotentialite team members**

People with diverse backgrounds and cross-domain expertise bring unique perspectives, connect dots others miss, and solve problems creatively. If you see “varied experience” as a strength rather than “lack of focus,” we'll work well together.

This isn't just theory. My multipotentiality comes from three distinct professional foundations:

**Making the world more usable** (10+ years)
From Foursquare to OpenStreetMap to PDF-XChange to 880+ GitHub projects—the driving force has always been the same: “People use this every day, spending more time than they should on simple tasks. I see how it could be better. Why not fix it?” Not just *can* improve things, but *can't not* improve them when the path is clear.

**Emergency services professionalism** (8 years)
Professional rescuer, firefighter, diver. Car accidents, structural collapses, wilderness emergencies. Every situation is unique. Decisions carry high risk. Data is always incomplete. Instructions matter. Personal responsibility is absolute. This experience fundamentally shaped how I approach testing: systematic thinking under pressure, attention to detail when it counts, and understanding that “good enough” isn't good enough when real people depend on your work.

**Empathy and perspective-taking** (30 camp counselor shifts, 600+ children)
Finding approaches for vastly different people. Putting yourself in their shoes completely—including imaginatively setting aside your own expertise to see the problem, documentation, or product through fresh eyes. Looking at familiar things with an unfamiliar gaze. This ability to mentally reset and view systems from a user's perspective, even in domains where I'm deeply competent, is rare. Without false modesty: I'm good at this, and it would be wasteful not to use it.

These three foundations create **transferable skills** that make multipotentialites valuable:

- **Rapid learning ability**: Can pick up new domains, tools, and technologies quickly
- **High adaptability**: Comfortable with change, uncertainty, and context-switching
- **Creative problem-solving**: Draw solutions from unexpected domains
- **Idea synthesis**: Connect concepts across different fields
- **Fresh perspectives**: Avoid domain blindness that affects specialists
- **Curiosity as a driver**: Genuine interest in understanding *why* things work
- **Outside-the-box thinking**: Not constrained by “how it's always been done”

For many, these advantages are obvious. What's less obvious is that they're specifically **profitable for companies** hiring M-shaped persons. You're not just getting someone who can do the job—you're getting someone who can improve how the job is done.

**Value depth AND breadth**

4+ years deep-diving into PDF-XChange + 5+ years exploring 880+ open source projects = someone who can both specialize intensely and adapt rapidly.

**Appreciate systematic thinking**

2,500+ filed issues across enterprise software, mass-market apps, and open source means I don't just find bugs—I find *patterns* in how software breaks.

**Recognize real-world testing experience**

From SAR operations (literally life-critical) to managing 50,000+ product documentation (1200+ brands, 500,000+ files) to field-testing OSM mapping tools—I test like an actual user, not just a checklist.

## Contribution Guidelines (The Employment Version)

### Before Opening an “Issue” (Job Offer)

1. **Check existing work**: Review the [portfolio README](README.md) to understand what I've done
2. **Review specializations**: [PDF-XChange deep dive](pdf-xchange.md), [GitHub breadth](github.md)
3. **Verify requirements match**: I'm strongest in manual QA, usability testing, documentation testing, and localization QA (Russian)

### How to Submit a “Pull Request” (Job Offer)

**Via LinkedIn** (preferred):
[linkedin.com/in/gallem/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gallem/)

**Via Email**:
Available on LinkedIn profile

**Please include**:
- Position title and description
- Location (or remote work policy)
- Team structure (will I be the only QA? Part of a QA team?)
- Tech stack / product domain
- Perspective on multipotentialite team members (bonus points)

## What Happens After Your “Contribution”

If your job offer leads to employment, expect:

1. **Immediate value**: I start finding issues on day one (it's a reflex at this point)
2. **Documentation improvements**: Whether it's internal wikis or public docs, they'll get better
3. **Long-term engagement**: I don't job-hop—I dig deep (4+ years at PDF-XChange, 8 years in emergency services)
4. **Portfolio updates**: This repository will get new case studies showing our work together
5. **Public recognition**: Successful contributors will be featured in the `README.md` with thanks and appropriate attribution—consider it professional visibility for your company
6. **Potential real FOSS contributions**: If your company has open source projects, I'll improve them too (*it will be very difficult for me to refrain from doing so*)

## Code of Conduct

### For This Repository
- Be respectful in communications
- Don't submit actual PRs to change portfolio content (they'll be closed with a smile)
- Feel free to open Issues for typos, broken links, or questions

### For Future Employment
- I'm collaborative, persistent, and kind
- I advocate for users, but I'm not combative with developers
- I bring curiosity, not ego
- I document findings thoroughly
- I respect work-life balance (mine and others')

## Questions?

**“Why is this file so long?”**
Because I'm thorough. It's literally what you'd hire me for.

**“Is this file itself a QA test?”**
Sort of? You're evaluating attention to detail, communication skills, and sense of humor simultaneously.

**“Do you actually expect employers to read all this?”**
The ones worth working with? Absolutely. If an employer can't read 2 pages about how I work, they won't value 250-page test reports either.

**“What if I just want to fix a typo?”**
Legitimately? Open an Issue or PR for that. I'll merge it. That's actual open source contribution.

**“You mention being a multipotentialite—what does that mean for teams?”**
It means I can:
- Bridge QA and Development communication gaps (I understand technical concepts deeply)
- Improve documentation while testing it (Technical Writer background)
- Think about UX while filing bugs (Content Manager experience)
- Test under pressure (SAR operations taught me that)
- Connect patterns across different domains (380+ projects tested)

The downside? I might occasionally go down rabbit holes. The upside? Those rabbit holes usually lead to finding the root cause of entire categories of bugs.
There's a humorous expression in Russian: `Kotelochek, ne vari!` (literally, “The pot is boiling too much”), ~“Stop, stop, you're spoiling me!” We may have to face this and be prepared for it.

## Recognition

If you're reading this far, you probably either:
1. Take hiring seriously (excellent)
2. Appreciate meta-humor about GitHub conventions (also excellent)
3. Are procrastinating on actual work by reading random CONTRIBUTING.md files (understandable)

Whichever category you're in, I appreciate you being here.

## License

This portfolio is **not open source** in the traditional sense—you can't fork my work history. But the *spirit* of open source—transparency, sharing knowledge, continuous improvement—absolutely applies.

Viewing this repository, learning from the case studies, and getting inspired for your own QA work? Go for it. Today you learned something from me. Tomorrow it will be my turn to learn something from you.
