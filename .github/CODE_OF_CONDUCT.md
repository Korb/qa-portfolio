## Wait, a Code of Conduct for a Portfolio?

Yes, I know. Portfolios don't typically have Codes of Conduct. They also don't typically have `CONTRIBUTING.md` files that tell you to hire the author.

But here's the thing: this document serves two purposes.

**First**, it's a demonstration that I understand what Codes of Conduct are for in real projects—setting expectations, building healthy communities, and preventing the kinds of dysfunction that kills collaboration.

**Second**—and more importantly—it's a wishlist. These are the values I hope to find in future colleagues. Think of it as reverse interviewing: you're evaluating me through this portfolio, and I'm articulating what kind of team I want to join.

So yes, this is half-serious. The principles are real. The framing is… realistic about what this document actually is.

## The Philosophy

Over 25+ years across 10+ different jobs, I've learned some things about what makes teams work—and what makes them implode. Here's what I value:

### On Knowledge Sharing

**The principle**: When you teach someone what you know, you're not creating competition—you're building a support network.

I learned this at a small trading and engineering company where I discovered that helping junior colleagues made them see me as a resource, not a threat. Years later, when I needed help, those same people had my back. Hoarding knowledge feels safe but leaves you competing alone against teams. Sharing knowledge is enlightened self-interest.

**Translation**: Help others. Future you will thank present you when you need something at 4 PM on Friday.

### On Individual Strengths

**The principle**: In any good team, everyone does something better than everyone else—and something worse than everyone else.

Working at a ceramics factory taught me this. The goal isn't uniformity; it's understanding who excels at what and distributing work accordingly. When people develop skills in pairs instead of isolation, the whole team grows stronger faster.

**Translation**: Know your teammates' strengths. Don't expect everyone to be good at everything. Structure work around actual capabilities, not org charts.

### On Clarity

**The principle**: If you can explain something to a 10-year-old, you actually understand it.

Teaching children for year showed me this. Before getting frustrated that someone “doesn't get it,” ask yourself: would a child understand your explanation? Probably not. Simplify. If it sounds smart but confusing, it's just confusing.

**Translation**: Clarity beats cleverness. Always.

### On Delegation

**The principle**: Trying to do everything yourself works—until it catastrophically doesn't.

I learned this the hard way at a integration startup, burning out while convinced I was “saving” the project. What actually happened: my health collapsed, my relationships suffered, and the project stalled anyway. People rise to meet responsibility when you give them a chance.

**Translation**: Trust people with real ownership. Your martyr complex helps no one.

### On Recovery

**The principle**: A 15-minute break beats another cup of coffee.

One of the best things about working at a translation company was their policy on power naps. Feeling stuck? About to explode? Step away. Do some pushups. Take a nap. The problem will still be there in 15 minutes, but you'll approach it as a functional human instead of a malfunctioning machine.

**Translation**: Rest is work. Treat it seriously.

### On Competence

**The principle**: Good intentions without competence can kill the best projects.

Eight years in search & rescue taught me this brutally. Sometimes operations moved forward *despite* certain specialists, not because of them. Enthusiasm matters, but execution matters more. You can work professionally with people you don't particularly like if you share a goal. You cannot work with incompetent people no matter how much you like them.

**Translation**: Choose collaborators for their ability, not just their personality. A shared mission bridges awkwardness; incompetence can't be fixed with friendship.

### On Irreplaceability

**The principle**: The moment someone believes they're irreplaceable, they become a liability.

Seeing this dynamic play out at a small contract factory producing sports nutrition was educational. When people become single points of failure, they gain leverage that corrupts decision-making. Good teams rotate responsibilities and cross-train.

**Translation**: Build systems, not dependencies on people. Including yourself.

### On Passion

**The principle**: Everyone has something at work they actually enjoy doing. Protect it.

My last job taught me this. When it seems like everything is falling apart, that you're stuck in a rut, when you get the impression that nobody cares about anything, that one thing someone loves might be the only reason they don't quit. When times get rough, let people spend time on what energizes them. It's not indulgence—it's retention.

**Translation**: Find what makes people excited about their work. Feed it. You'll thank yourself during the next crisis.

## Behavioral Expectations

### Kindness Without Passivity

Be polite. Be direct. Don't be passive-aggressive. If something's broken, say so. If you're impressed, say that too. Honest kindness is the goal, not performative niceness.

### Intent vs Impact

Most people don't set out to make things worse. But intent doesn't erase impact. If someone's actions create problems, address the impact directly while assuming they didn't mean harm.

### Healthy Conflict

Disagreements are normal and healthy. Personal attacks, mockery, harassment, and discrimination are not. Debate ideas vigorously. Respect people unconditionally.

### Intellectual Humility

You can be wrong. I can be wrong. Changing your mind when presented with better information isn't weakness—it's growth. Defend your position when you have good reasons, but stay open to the possibility that someone else might be right.

## Scope

This applies to interactions in this repository: issues, pull requests, discussions, and any related communication.

## Enforcement

If someone violates these principles in ways that harm others, I reserve the right to:
- Issue a warning
- Temporarily block contributions
- Permanently ban from the project

Honestly, I hope this never happens. This is a portfolio repo, not a warzone.

## Attribution

Inspired by the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) and [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](https://opensource.guide/code-of-conduct/), tempered by more than two and a half decades of watching teams succeed and fail for entirely predictable reasons.

## Questions?

**“Why is this so long for a portfolio repo?”**
Because I'm demonstrating that I understand what good Codes of Conduct do, and what values matter in teams. Also, if you're evaluating me for QA work, you should probably appreciate thoroughness.

**“Are you actually expecting people to read this?”**
People who care about team culture? Yes. People who don't? They'll skip it, and that tells me something too.

**“Do these principles actually work?”**
They helped me, and who knows, they might help you too. Give it a try.

**“What if I just want to fix a typo?”**
Do it. Open a PR. I'll merge it. That's actual collaboration, not philosophical discussion.

## Final Note

If you've read this far, you probably either:
1. Take team culture seriously (excellent)
2. Are procrastinating (understandable)
3. Are evaluating whether you want to work with me (practical)

Whichever category you're in, I appreciate you being here.

## TL;DR

**Good teams**: Share knowledge, understand individual strengths, communicate clearly, delegate trust, prioritize recovery, value competence, avoid hero complexes, let people do what they love.

**Good behavior**: Kind but direct, assumes good intent, debates ideas (not people), stays intellectually humble.

**Bad behavior**: Personal attacks, mockery, harassment, discrimination—basically, don't be the reason someone dreads opening GitHub.

*This Code of Conduct exists because every serious project should think about team dynamics—even when that project is a portfolio about taking dynamics seriously.*
